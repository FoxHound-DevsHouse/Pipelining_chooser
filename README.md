# Fireworks AI API Integration for Prompt-Based Generation

This Python script demonstrates how to integrate with the Fireworks AI API to generate text based on a given prompt, incorporating image uploads as well.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- Python installed on your system
- An API key from Fireworks AI. You can obtain this by signing up for their service and creating an API key.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Replace `<API_KEY>` in the script with your actual Fireworks AI API key.

3. Ensure your input payload (`payload` dictionary) is configured according to your requirements. Adjust parameters such as `model`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`, `temperature`, and `prompt` based on your desired text generation settings.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python fireworks_ai_integration.py
    ```

2. Upon execution, the script sends a POST request to the Fireworks AI API with the user prompt provided in the payload.

3. The API generates text based on the prompt and returns the response.

4. The script then extracts and prints the generated text.

## Script Explanation

- `url`: The endpoint for the Fireworks AI API.
- `payload`: Configuration parameters including the model to use, maximum tokens, presence penalty, frequency penalty, temperature, and the user prompt.
- `headers`: HTTP headers including content type and authorization. Replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key.
- `response`: Sends a POST request to the API and captures the response.
- `llm_response`: Extracts the generated text from the API response and prints it.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you comply with Fireworks AI's terms of service and usage policies when using their API.
- This script provides a basic example of interacting with the Fireworks AI API for text generation based on user prompts, including the incorporation of image uploads within the prompts.
